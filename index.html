    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment 
        (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects 
        of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
         and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures
         , and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes 
         by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
         <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
             Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements
              on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
         </li>
         <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
             For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity
              of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
            </li>

    <header><h2>Javascript And Java</h2></header></section>
    <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript 
        language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
         most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why
          it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>
        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations,
        JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
         Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common 
         class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
          can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements.
           Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
         and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

<p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
<li>The name of the function.</li>
<li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
<li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
<p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
<code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
<p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
<code>return number * number;</code>
<p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
